# ExamSpark — Credit Economy Model (v2)

> **Saved:** Jul 2026 — founder `save` (v2 supersedes v1)
> **Rule:** Most features are session/feature-based. **Exception (founder Jul 22, 2026):** Recording + Audio Upload = **1 credit per minute** (actual length, round up, max 180). YouTube stays banded. Never show rupee amounts for AI cost in UI.

---

## Core Principle

Users see **Credits** (or single translated usage estimate) — **never rupee amounts for AI cost**.

Internal (**backend only**): **1 Credit ≈ ₹0.15 charged-value**

---

## Plans & Credits (Volume Discount)

| Plan | Price | Credits | Effective ₹/Credit |
|------|-------|---------|-------------------|
| Free | ₹0 | 50 / **month** | — |
| ₹199 | ₹199 | 1,500 | ₹0.133 |
| ₹499 | ₹499 | 3,500 | ₹0.143 |
| ₹999 | ₹999 | 8,000 | ₹0.124 |
| Teacher ₹2,999 | ₹2,999 | 16,000 | ₹0.187 |

Plan IDs: `free` (gating only) · `plan_199` · `plan_499` · `plan_999` · `teacher`

**Jul 23, 2026:** Teacher plan price **₹1,999 → ₹2,999** (credits stay 16,000). Setup gate: [`TEACHER_PLATFORM.md`](TEACHER_PLATFORM.md) §1b.

**Jul 13, 2026 update:** `plan_199` 1,300 → 1,500 credits (Ask AI headroom — see "Fee-Corrected Margin Validation" below) · `teacher` 20,000 → 16,000 (60hr/month max-usage risk-ceiling validation, not a margin change).

Bigger plans = lower effective per-credit rate (buy more, save more).

**Free credits — founder Jul 15, 2026: 75 → 50/month on Free plan only (monthly reset, not daily).**

| Who | Credits |
|-----|---------|
| **Guest** (no signup) | **1 free Ask prompt per device** (stored locally so refresh does not reset). Clearing site/app data can reset — server IP limit when guest AI is live. No credit balance, no Record/Attach |
| **Free** (signed up) | **50 credits** at signup (+ Free monthly allotment when reset ships) — Ask/PDF/Photo cut credits. Audio locked until ₹499+ |
| **Paid** (`plan_199` / `499` / `999` / `teacher`) | Their **plan package only** (1,500 / 3,500 / 8,000 / 16,000). **Do not** also grant Free’s 50 |

Audio (record + audio upload) plan-locked until **₹499+**.

**Teacher credits ceiling resized Jul 13, 2026 — 20,000 → 16,000/month.** Re-validated against a **60 hours/month maximum-usage** assumption (not the typical ~20hr/month case): 60hrs of recording (mostly 60–90min sessions, ≈48 sessions × 120 credits = 5,760 credits) + **every single lecture** also getting Flashcards+Quiz+Revision+Formula+MindMap (~60 credits × 48 = 2,880 credits, after Jul 16 extras repricing) + heavy Ask AI (200 Normal + 50 Deep ≈ 1,600 credits) tops out at **~10,240 credits even in this extreme case**. Adding a 15–20% safety buffer on top still keeps **16,000** comfortably safe. This remains a **risk/abuse-ceiling** adjustment, not a margin lever — real teacher AI cost even at the 60hr extreme is only a small fraction of ₹1,999 charged.

---

## Buy Extra Credits (a-la-carte top-up — founder-locked Jul 13, 2026)

For users who don't want to upgrade their subscription plan but need more credits this month. **No teacher commission applies** — commission is only on recurring subscription price, not one-time top-ups.

| Pack | Credits | Price | ₹/Credit |
|------|---------|-------|----------|
| `pack_100` | 100 | ₹25 | ₹0.25 |
| `pack_500` | 500 | ₹110 | ₹0.22 |
| `pack_1000` | 1,000 | ₹200 | ₹0.20 |
| `pack_5000` | 5,000 | ₹850 | ₹0.17 |
| `pack_10000` | 10,000 | ₹1,500 | ₹0.15 |

**Pricing rule:** Per-credit rate is always **≥** the cheapest subscription plan's rate (`plan_199` = ₹0.133/credit) — top-ups never undercut the incentive to subscribe.

**Margin (worst-case Google Play 15% fee):**
- `pack_100` (₹25): −₹3.75 fee, −₹1.50 real AI cost, −₹0.50 hosting → **EBITDA ₹19.25 (~77%)**
- `pack_10000` (₹1,500): −₹225 fee, −₹150 real AI cost, −₹5 hosting → **EBITDA ₹1,120 (~75%)**

**Status:** Pricing/catalog live in `subscription_plans.dart` (`creditPacks`) and `credit_packs` table. Live checkout is Phase 5 Session 6 (Razorpay webhooks) work.

---

## Non-API Actions (Always Free — founder-locked Jul 12, 2026)

Codifies the existing "Library read = free" rule with concrete examples, so Phase 5 backend only deducts credits on actions that trigger a **new** AI API call — never on reading something already generated:

- Viewing/re-reading previously generated **Notes, Summary, Transcript, Flashcards, Quiz** for any lecture you own or have access to (Library)
- Browsing **Group feed**, **Progress**, **Profile**, **Settings** — no AI call involved
- **Selecting text** anywhere (`AskAiSelectableText`) is free — only tapping "Ask AI" and sending the question costs credits (that's the new API call)
- Re-opening a Group's shared-content preview sheet — free; only generating something new from it costs credits

If an action doesn't call Whisper/Qwen/Tavily, it doesn't cost credits — full stop.

## Feature Credit Costs (Session/Feature-Based)

| Feature | Credits |
|---------|---------|
| **Recording / Audio Upload** | **1 credit per minute** (actual length, round up, max 180 min) |
| Summary | Included with recording |
| Ask AI (Normal) | 5 |
| Ask AI (Deep) | 12 |
| Ask AI + live web search (Tavily, current events only) | 10 |
| Ask AI Deep + live web search | 20 |
| **Home AI study chips** (Flashcards / Quiz / Revision / Mind Map / etc. from that answer’s Knowledge Object) | **0** — included after Ask; Regenerate paid |
| **Select AI — Explain / Simplify / Translate / Memory Trick / Exam View / Ask follow-up** | **2** |
| **Select AI — Quiz from selection (5 MCQ)** | **3** |
| **Select AI — Flashcards from selection (5)** | **3** |
| Flashcards | 5 |
| Quiz (20 MCQ) | 5 |
| Important Questions | 20 |
| Revision Notes | 5 |
| 5 Minute Revision | 5 |
| Formula Sheet | 15 |
| Mind Map | 30 |
| Diagram/Image (Qwen3-VL) | 25 |
| Home AI Camera / Upload Image (chat answer) | 10 |
| PDF Analysis | 20 |
| OCR Image | 15 |
| Translate | 8 |
| Voice Read | 5 |
| YouTube Link → Notes (≤30 min) | 10 |
| YouTube Link → Notes (30–60 min) | 20 |
| YouTube Link → Notes (60–90 min) | 40 |

**Critical:** Most credits are **feature-based**. **Recording / Audio Upload** charge **1 credit per minute** of actual length (founder-approved Jul 22, 2026). YouTube stays banded. Never show rupee amounts for AI cost in UI.

### Recording / Audio Upload — per-minute (Jul 22, 2026)

- **Rate:** 1 credit per minute (round up to next full minute).
- **Source of length:** server ffprobe / elapsed minutes — not the planned-duration chip.
- **Hard max:** 180 minutes (3 hours). Longer → friendly reject, zero charge.
- **Charge once** after Whisper + notes succeed. Failure = free.
- **YouTube Link → Notes** stays on separate bands (10 / 20 / 40), max 90 min.

### YouTube Link → Notes (updated Jul 21, 2026)

- **Credits:** 10 / 20 / 40 by length (≤30 / 30–60 / 60–90 min) — cheaper than Record; unlock on **Free+** (uses credits).
- **Captions first;** if no CC → temp audio + **Whisper Turbo only** (no expensive non-Turbo fallback).
- **Hard limit:** 90 minutes max per video.
- **Restriction:** Public videos only.

## Margin Validation (Internal — Healthy)

**Recomputed Jul 12, 2026 with real Groq/Qwen pricing** (see [`TECH_STACK.md`](TECH_STACK.md) Real Cost Reference) — actual cost came in even lower than the original estimates below:

| Feature | Charged (₹) | Real AI Cost (computed) | Margin |
|---------|-------------|--------------------------|--------|
| Record 60 min (1 credit/min → 60 cr ≈ ₹9) | ₹9 | ~₹3.1 | ~66% |
| Record 90 min (90 cr ≈ ₹13.5) | ₹13.5 | ~₹5.6 | ~59% |
| Record 180 min (180 cr ≈ ₹27) | ₹27 | ~₹11–12 | ~56–59% |
| Ask AI Normal (~500 in / 300 out tokens) | ₹0.75 | ~₹0.03 | ~96% |
| Ask AI Deep (~1,500 in / 800 out tokens) | ₹1.80 | ~₹0.08 | ~95% |
| Diagram (Qwen3-VL-Flash, default) | ₹3.75 | ~₹0.02 | ~99% |
| Diagram (Qwen3-VL-Plus, rare escalation) | ₹3.75 | ~₹0.07 | ~98% |
| Quiz (20 MCQ, text-only) | ₹3.75 | ~₹0.10 | ~97% |
| PDF Analysis (text-only, Free-tier eligible) | ₹3 | ~₹0.10–0.20 | ~93–97% |

The buffer between real AI cost and charged credits covers Razorpay's ~2% fee, Redis/Railway/R2 hosting, and the occasional non-turbo/Qwen3-VL-Plus escalation — pricing stays as-is for now.

### Margin after 30% Teacher Commission (per plan, per month) — superseded below

| Plan | Price | Teacher Commission (30%) | Typical AI Cost/mo | Platform Net |
|------|-------|---------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| ₹199 | ₹199 | ₹59.70 | ~₹10–30 | ~₹110–130 (~55–65%) |
| ₹499 | ₹499 | ₹149.70 | ~₹30–70 | ~₹280–320 (~56–64%) |
| ₹999 | ₹999 | ₹299.70 | ~₹60–150 | ~₹550–640 (~55–64%) |

Even after paying teachers 30%, the platform keeps ~55–65% net margin at every tier, because per-feature AI cost is only 4–30% of charged value (see table above). **Caveat found Jul 13, 2026: this table never subtracted the payment gateway / Google Play cut — see the corrected version below.**

### Fee-Corrected Margin Validation (founder-locked Jul 13, 2026 — worst-case assumption)

Adds the missing **payment gateway fee** line — assumes **worst case: every payment goes through Android/Google Play Billing at 15%** (vs. Web/Razorpay's ~2%). Commission stays at 30% (unchanged, per founder decision — the credit/ceiling adjustment this round is about the teacher's own monthly allocation, not the commission rate).

| Plan | Price | Google Play Fee (15%, worst case) | Teacher Commission (30%) | Real AI Cost | Hosting | Platform EBITDA |
|------|-------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| ₹199 | ₹199 | −₹29.85 | −₹59.70 | −₹7 to −₹10 (no audio feature on this tier) | −₹3 | **~₹99–102 (~50–51%)** |
| ₹499 | ₹499 | −₹74.85 | −₹149.70 | −₹30 to −₹50 | −₹4 | **~₹220–240 (~44–48%)** |
| ₹999 | ₹999 | −₹149.85 | −₹299.70 | −₹60 to −₹105 | −₹5 | **~₹440–485 (~44–48%)** |

**Findings:**
- **₹199** lands almost exactly at the 50% EBITDA target even in the worst case — it has no audio/recording feature, so real AI cost stays cheap. This is what freed the room to bump its credits 1,300 → 1,500 (see Buy Extra Credits / Plans table above).
- **₹499 / ₹999** land at ~44–48% EBITDA in the worst case, below 50% — driven by the more expensive recording feature plus the Google Play cut. **This is a flagged watch-item, not yet acted on** — founder decision (Jul 13, 2026) was to leave the 30% commission unchanged this round. If a **blended/actual** fee split is used instead of worst-case (e.g. more users checking out via Web/Razorpay's ~2% fee), EBITDA on these tiers recovers to **~70–75%**. Revisit once real Web-vs-Android payment split data is available, or explicitly ask to solve for exactly 50% here (would need commission ~24% instead of 30%, uniformly across tiers).
- **Teacher ₹2,999** plan has no commission line item (it's the teacher's own plan, not a commission payout) — price raised Jul 23, 2026 from ₹1,999; credits unchanged at 16,000. Re-check Play-fee EBITDA when live payment split is known.

## Teacher Commission (founder-locked Jul 12, 2026)

**Rate:** 30% of a student's subscription price, **recurring every month** the student stays subscribed — not a one-time signup bonus.

**Who qualifies:** Any student who is a member of the teacher's Group **and** has an active paid plan (₹199/₹499/₹999) — regardless of how or when they joined the group or bought the plan.

**Attribution rule (avoids double-paying):** A student can be a member of multiple teachers' Groups, but only **one** teacher earns commission on them at a time — their **primary teacher**, defined as the teacher who owns the Group with the **most recent `joined_at`** among all of that student's active `class_memberships`. If the student later joins a newer Group (more recent `joined_at`), the primary teacher automatically switches on the next calculation — no manual reassignment needed.

**Scope today (Phase 4):** Display-only. The Teacher Dashboard's "Estimated Commission" card (see [`TEACHER_PLATFORM.md`](TEACHER_PLATFORM.md)) shows this as a calculated estimate via `fn_teacher_estimated_commission()`. **No real money moves** — actual payout to a teacher's bank account (Razorpay Route / manual payout) is explicit Phase 5 work per the "Revenue/commission live wiring" gate.

**Code:** `teacher_profiles.commission_rate` (default `0.30`, kept per-teacher configurable for future flexibility) · `fn_teacher_estimated_commission(p_teacher_id)` in `schema.sql` / `teacher_commission_migration.sql`.

## Plan-Tier Feature Gating

| Plan | Features Unlocked |
|------|-------------------|
| **Free** | Ask AI + PDF + Photo/Diagram + study extras (when live) — **credits only**. **Audio recording/upload locked.** Cannot join Groups. **50 credits/month.** |
| **₹199** (`plan_199`) | More credits. Join up to 1 Group. **Audio still locked.** |
| **₹299** (optional re-entry) | Same as ₹199 if reintroduced |
| **₹499** | **Audio recording/upload unlocked.** Join up to 3 Groups. |
| **₹999** | Full access — no locks. Join up to 6 Groups. |
| **Teacher ₹2,999** | Bulk record + PDF export + share links + class dashboard. **Create** unlimited own Groups (setup gate). **Cannot join** another teacher’s Group as a student (`max_groups=0` join). Jul 26, 2026. |

**Founder Jul 15, 2026:** Free monthly credits **75 → 50**. Ask/PDF/Photo = Free + credits. **Audio unlock = ₹499+** (Free and ₹199 locked). Home mic / Attach → Audio File show lock **before** starting the flow.

Check order: (1) plan unlock (audio only) → (2) credit balance. Server-side only.

## Group Join Limits (founder-locked Jul 12, 2026)

| Plan | Max Groups a student can join |
|------|-------------------------------|
| Free | 0 — shows "Upgrade to join Groups" |
| ₹199 | 1 |
| ₹499 | 3 |
| ₹999 | 6 |
| Teacher | Unlimited (owns groups) |

- **Client:** `GroupsRepository.canJoinAnotherGroup()` (fail-closed on RPC/network error) + "Buy Plan" sheet (`buy_plan_sheet.dart`) on Groups tab/list, Group Info, and "Join a Class" dialog.
- **Server (source of truth):** trigger `trg_enforce_group_join_limit` / `fn_enforce_group_join_limit` blocks `INSERT` into `class_memberships` when at/above plan `max_groups`. Migration: `group_join_limits_enforce_migration.sql`.
- **Refund / plan drop / month expiry:** `fn_trim_group_memberships` — Free leaves all; downgrade keeps newest `joined_at` up to new max. Called from `refund_service` **and** DB trigger `trg_trim_groups_on_subscription_change` on `user_subscriptions` status/plan/period change (`subscription_change_trim_groups_migration.sql`).
- "Copy Code" was removed from the Teacher Dashboard's group card (Jul 12, 2026) — "Share Invite Link" (`examspark.app/join/{joinCode}`) is now the only invite path, matching the format used on the Group Info screen's "Share Group" button.

### Join approval vs plan (founder-locked Jul 23, 2026)

Separate from max_groups counts. Full text: [`TEACHER_PLATFORM.md`](TEACHER_PLATFORM.md) §5 Paid vs Free.

- Teacher Create Group choice: **Auto** or **Approve**
- **Free** student + Approve group → **Pending** (teacher Accept/Reject)
- **₹199 / ₹499 / ₹999** student → **always Auto join** (skip Pending even if group is Approve)
- Institute bulk free join / kick-remove → **future**
- Does **not** remove max_groups caps above

## Implementation Rules

1. Deduct credits **server-side only**
2. Plan tier check **before** balance check
3. Never show rupee amounts for AI actions in UI
4. Per-feature/session pricing only — enforce in config + UI copy

## Future Credit Costs (not live)

| Action | Credits | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Group Invite Link share (student) | 100 | Configurable; anti-spam — **not** content sharing |

Students never spend credits to share notes/PDF — content share blocked entirely.

## Code

- `credit_costs.dart` — locked costs + `recordCreditsForDurationMinutes()`
- `plan_tier_gating.dart` — tier unlocks
- `credit_usage_display.dart` — dashboard translated estimates
- `subscription_plans.dart` — plan catalog + `maxGroups` per plan + `creditPacks` (Buy Extra Credits)
- `groups_repository.dart` — `canJoinAnotherGroup()` (Group Join Limits above)
- `credit_economy_v2_1_migration.sql` — DB sync for the Jul 13, 2026 numbers (founder must run once)
